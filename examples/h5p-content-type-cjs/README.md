# H5P Content Type with webpack

This is a boilerplate for creating H5P content types with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).
The code itself is very simplistic and only serves as a starting point for your own content type.
The project uses webpack as build tool.
This is the most common way of building H5P content types.
If you want to opt for something that is quicker to build, you can check out the [Vite template](../h5p-content-type-vite/).
